### About
_Iâ€™m a humble team player, yet I donâ€™t have any issue to roll up my sleeve when push comes to shove. I have expertise in HTML, CSS and WordPress. I like to structure, prioritize and plan my work, because I often work with many parallel activities._

_I study Web Development at Mid Sweden University and take my degree at 2021. Currently I freelance as a web developer at webbnord.se where I assist in developing websites for small to medium sized companies._
